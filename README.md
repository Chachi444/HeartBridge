# HeartBridge
HeartBridge is a minimalist, professional web app that empowers elderly individuals to request help with everyday tasksâ€”such as shopping, medication pickup, and household chores. Designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, the interface allows users to submit requests effortlessly, without visual clutter or complexity. Volunteers can view open requests, respond promptly, and offer meaningful support within their communities. By fostering trust, dignity, and connection, HeartBridge bridges the gap between those in need and those willing to help. The platform promotes compassionate action and strengthens local networks through a clean, intuitive experience built for accessibility and care.
